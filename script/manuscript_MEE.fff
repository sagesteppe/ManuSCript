The innermost ring indicates every genus which Queen Bee's were observed to visit. The intermediate ring indicates that at least a single morphological pollen voucher slide was prepared for a member of the genus. The outermost ring indicates that sequence data were available for at least a member of that genus. Branch colors follow APG 4.}\label{fig:Sequence and Morphological Vouchers}
